INTRODUCTIONHydrogen evolution   reaction (HER) is an electrochemical reaction that splits    water   molecule   to   produce   hydrogen   (H2)   gas   at   the   cost   of   current   (Figure   1a).   To   improve   the   efficiency   of   H2   production,   electrocatalysts   are required   to   increase   the      rate   of   HER. Electrocatalysts for HER involve expensive precious metals (e.g., platinum,   palladium,   ruthenium,   etc.)   due to their   high   catalytic   activities.   However, the   high   cost   and   low   abundance   of the   precious   metals   limit the   potential   of achieving   H2-powered   sustainable society.To   increase   the   efficiency   of   precious   metals,   their   nanoparticle   forms   are   effectively   loaded to   porous carbon   nanomaterials   (Figure   1b). The   use of metal   nanoparticles and   porous   carbon   nanomaterials   offers   great   advantages   of   large   specific surface   area,   exposed active sites,   high electrical conductivity,   and   goodstability in the   electrolyte   (Figure   1c).[1-4]      To   further   enhance   its   performance,   mesopores (2-50 nm in   diameter)   are   introduced   to   these   carbon   materials   to   increase   the   surface   area   and   ensure   that   underlying    active    sites    embedded in the carbon are more accessible to reactant   molecules.   This attempt, also known as pore engineering, improves    electrochemical   wettability   and   accessibility of the   reactant   molecules   by tuning   different   pore sizes   on   the   materials.   Further   increasing the   pore   size to   the macropore region   (above 50   nm   in   diameter)   can improve rate capability but   will   severely reduce   surface      area,      and   further   reducing   the   pore   to   micropore   region   (below 2 nm   in   diameter) will   restrict   diffusion but will enhance the surface area.[3, 4]

(c) Schematic   illustrations   of classes of nanopores depending on their diameters.Recently,   metal-organic   frameworks   (MOFs)   have   been   utilized   to   synthesize   porous   carbon   materials   via   direct carbonization.   ZIF-8,   which   is   a   type   of   MOF   nanoparticle   can   be   easily   converted   into   carbon via   pyrolysis   (heating to   high temperature)   due to   its   abundant   organic   linkers   in the structure   (Figure   2a). The   resultant   carbon was   able   to maintain its original morphology, its   rich   micropores,   and   its   high   surface   area.Through      pore   engineerin,      ZIF-8    nanoparticles      will    acquire      tuned    pore    distribution   ranging   from      micropore   to      mesopore,   and   subsequent   direct-carbonization   will   give   rise   to   MOF-derived   porous   carbons   largely   inheriting   the   morphology   and   nanopores   from    its    MOF    precursor.      MOF-derived   porous    carbons    with    tuned    nanopores    can   ensure the effective use of surface area and easy access to catalysts      (Figure      2a).   Scanning   electron   microscope   (SEM)   images   of   the   exemplary   MOF,   pore-engineered   MOF   and   its   porous   carbon   demonstrate the   evolution   of   morphological   and   pore   size   changes   at   each   stage   (Figure   2b-e).[5]

Adopted from   Ref.   5 with   permission.As general carbon materials do not   exhibit   superior   HER   performance   due to the   lack   of   active   sites,   loading metal nanoparticles can tremendously   increase   its   electrocatalytic   activity.      Unlike      pure      metal      catalysts,      metal      nanoparticles      can      be      homogeneously   dispersed   throughout   the   porous   carbon   surface,   hence   increasing   its   exposed   active   site as   more reactants are   accessible to   metal   atom.In   this   project   students   will   reveal   the   type   ofmetal   loaded   to   porous   carbon   using   the      characterisation      techniques      covered    in       the      lecture●      They      will      gain      deeper   understanding      on   X-ray   diffraction      (XRD),   scanning      electron      microscopy      (SEM),      and   transmission   electron   microscopy   (TEM)   as   they   use   the   knowledge   from   the   lecture   and   relevant   data   acquired.   The   four   materials   to   be   studied   in   this   project   are:   ZF-8,   pore-engineeredzIF-8, porous   carbon   andmetal-loadedporous   carbo.
